# Stage 7 Baseline Audit Report (READ-ONLY)

Date (UTC): 2026-10-11
Scope: Stage 7 Valuation Engine baseline audit. No source, test, spec, dependency, or config modifications made. Stages 1-6, 8, 9 untouched. No git operations performed.

## 1. Files Inspected

- D:/winprojects/analyzer/temp_report2.md (confirmed empty before writing; this report is the first content)

## 2. Test Command and Observed Counts

Command (cwd D:/winprojects/analyzer):
D:/winprojects/analyzer/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest src/tests/test_stage7_valuation.py -q

Result: 11 passed, 0 failed. One pre-existing warning class only: DeprecationWarning for datetime.datetime.utcnow() at src/valuation/engine.py:176 (10 warnings, cosmetic; not part of the finding).

## 3. Evidence-Backed Top Finding

The required sensitivity/dependence alert family (spec sections 49-53; stress tests 77-79) is unimplemented, and the driver analysis it depends on is a fixed stub.

Missing required alerts (spec section 49 uses mandatory language): ASSESSMENT_FLIP_RISK (section 50 calls it one of the most important alerts), HIGH_MULTIPLE_DEPENDENCE (51), HIGH_EPS_DEPENDENCE (52), MARGIN_ASSUMPTION_RISK (53), plus HIGH_IMPACT_HIGH_UNCERTAINTY, POOR_DATA_QUALITY, and POINT_IN_TIME_WARNING. Engine._alerts (engine.py lines 451-485) emits only: HIGH_SCENARIO_DISPERSION, LOW_FORECAST_RELIABILITY, INSUFFICIENT_BENCHMARK_DATA, target/historical/industry divergence WATCH alerts, and an INFO top-driver note. None of the flip-risk or dependence alerts can be produced by any input.

Supporting evidence:
- parameters.py line 72 defines ALERT_THRESHOLDS["high_dependence_share"] = 0.60, but a repository search shows zero references to high_dependence_share anywhere in src/ outside that definition. It is a dead threshold: the dependence-alert logic it was meant to parameterize does not exist.
- _driver_analysis (engine.py lines 430-448) hardcodes exactly two drivers, EPS and TARGET_PE, with identical impact values (|base fair value| x perturbation), so driver_impact is always 50.0/50.0 and uncertainty is identical for both drivers regardless of inputs. There is no sector driver decomposition required by spec sections 42-44 (non-financial Revenue-to-EPS chain, bank Loans/NII chain, holding NAV chain).
- The engine accepts nav_per_share but only stores it in metadata ("nav_per_share_received"); it is never used in any calculation, confirming the holding/NAV path is unwired.
- No test among the 11 covers flip-risk, multiple/EPS dependence, margin-assumption risk, or sector drivers.

Classification: this is missing coverage plus unimplemented required behavior, NOT a proven behavioral defect. All 11 existing tests pass and no test demonstrates incorrect output for implemented paths (forward P/E math, benchmark hierarchy, 8-peer rule, invalid-EPS NULL rule, reliability non-interference, family-level probability evidence, bounded scenario multiples all verified by tests).

Secondary observations (not the top finding):
- Minor contract gap: spec section 69 requires industry_peer_count in the output contract, but ValuationResult has no such field; only the minimum (benchmark_peer_minimum: 8) is recorded in metadata, so consumers cannot see the actual peer count behind an industry median.
- Unverified assumption (not a defect): point-in-time safety. The engine accepts historical_pe_values as undated floats and records "pit_inputs_required": True in metadata, but it has no mechanism to detect future-dated data. PIT correctness therefore rests entirely on the frozen upstream stages; no test exercises a PIT violation.

## 4. Six-Layer Validation Status

1. Unit/formula: HAS EVIDENCE. test_valuation_models plus engine forward-P/E/fair-value/expected-value assertions pass (11/11 total).
2. Contract/boundary: PARTIAL EVIDENCE. 8-peer minimum, benchmark hierarchy fallback order, invalid-EPS NULL handling, and probability-sum-to-100% are tested. Still needs work: industry_peer_count absent from output; historical series not passed through (only median).
3. Production-path/integration: NO EVIDENCE. All tests use a synthetic make_forecast fixture; no test runs the engine on real Stage 5/Stage 6 outputs. Stage 6 reliability 0-100 scale compatibility was verified by reading the spec only (engine clamps defensively).
4. Adversarial/negative: PARTIAL EVIDENCE. Negative EPS, unknown/incomplete evidence families, rationale-free and oversized multiple adjustments are tested. Still needs work: no PIT-violation test, no zero/negative price test, no NaN EPS test.
5. Regression: NO EVIDENCE. No regression corpus or backtest harness; model/contract version fields are emitted but prior-version behavior is untested.
6. Independent audit: IN PROGRESS. This report is the first independent implementation-vs-spec check; no prior independent verification found.

No unexecuted tests were claimed as passed.

## 5. Scope Confirmation

Read-only audit as instructed. Inspected only the listed files. Ran only the specified pytest command. No edits, commits, pushes, branch changes, dependency changes, or GitHub/API calls. No financial data, formulas, or defaults were invented. No tests were weakened or skipped. Stages 1-6 treated as frozen.

## 6. Recommended Next Step (Narrow, Test-First, No Implementation Done Here)

Add failing-first tests for the dependence/flip-risk alert family, scoped strictly to ValuationEngine._alerts and _driver_analysis: (a) a stable-EPS case whose bull fair value comes mostly from target-P/E expansion must raise HIGH_MULTIPLE_DEPENDENCE using the currently dead high_dependence_share (0.60) threshold; (b) a threshold-adjacent upside case (small EPS or margin perturbation flips ATTRACTIVE to FAIR) must raise ASSESSMENT_FLIP_RISK. Do not change frozen stages, the output contract, or any currently passing behavior to do this.
